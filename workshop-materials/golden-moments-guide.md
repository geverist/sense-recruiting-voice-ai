# üé¨ Golden Moments: Example Call Recordings Guide

This guide provides sample call scenarios to demonstrate different outcomes and teaching moments for your workshop.

## Purpose

Playing pre-recorded example calls helps workshop attendees:
- **Understand** what good vs. bad AI recruiting conversations sound like
- **Learn** from real-world scenarios and edge cases
- **Calibrate** their expectations for AI performance
- **Identify** areas for improvement in their own implementations

## Recording These Calls

### How to Create Example Calls

1. **Use your Twilio number** to call yourself or a colleague
2. **Play different candidate personas** (enthusiastic, skeptical, confused, etc.)
3. **Record using Twilio's call recording** (already enabled in outbound-call-answer.js)
4. **Download recordings** from Twilio Console ‚Üí Voice ‚Üí Logs ‚Üí Recordings
5. **Label and organize** for easy playback during workshop

    talking to a real recruiter later - I'm just here to save you time on
    scheduling and basic questions. Is that okay with you?

Candidate: I guess... This is kind of weird though. Can't I just talk to a person?

AI: Absolutely! If you prefer, I can have a member of our recruiting team call you
    within 24 hours instead. Would you like that?

Candidate: No, no... I'm just curious how this works. What kind of questions will
          you ask?

AI: Great question! I'll ask about your experience with cloud infrastructure, your
    availability to start, and your salary expectations. The whole call should take
    about 4 minutes. If anything seems off or you want to switch to a human at any

AI: Impressive! You mentioned 1,000 pods - how did you handle autoscaling at that level?

Candidate: We used horizontal pod autoscaling based on custom metrics...

[AI references earlier answers throughout conversation]

AI: Earlier you mentioned working with AWS - did you use EKS or self-managed clusters?

Candidate: We actually used self-managed...
