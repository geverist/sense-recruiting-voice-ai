## üìß Pre-Workshop Communication for Attendees

**Workshop:** TalentFlow by Sense - AI Recruiting Voice Assistant
**Duration:** 3 Hours
**Date:** [Your Workshop Date]
**Instructor:** [Your Name]

## üéØ What You'll Build

By the end of this hands-on workshop, you'll have built **Simon**, a British AI recruiting assistant that:

- ‚úÖ Makes outbound screening calls to candidates
- ‚úÖ Uses natural conversational AI (via Twilio ConversationRelay + OpenAI)
- ‚úÖ Captures skills, salary expectations, and work preferences
- ‚úÖ Integrates with Segment CDP for candidate tracking
- ‚úÖ Syncs data to Greenhouse ATS
- ‚úÖ Routes qualified candidates to human recruiters in Twilio Flex

**The Problem We're Solving:**
Recruitment teams waste 60-70% of their time on repetitive screening calls. AI automation can handle initial outreach, qualification, and scheduling - freeing recruiters to focus on building relationships with top talent.

**The Solution:**
An end-to-end recruiting engagement platform using:
- **Twilio Voice** - Outbound calling infrastructure
- **ConversationRelay** - Real-time AI conversations
- **OpenAI GPT-4** - Natural language understanding
- **Segment CDP** - Candidate journey tracking
- **Twilio Flex** - Human recruiter handoff
- **Greenhouse ATS** - Applicant tracking
